# Xcode_OpenGL_on_iOS_with_Gyro

In this experimentation, the user sees in VR on his iPhone.
There are a cube and a skybox that rotates at current speed around the user.
When the user change its orientation, the view is adapted to show the new direction.

This was tested on october 2015 with Xcode 7 and iPhone4.


Note: There are a few flags in GameViewController.m that permit ot change the behaviour of the app.
Note: The flag USE_TEXTURE is not working yet (oct 2015).
